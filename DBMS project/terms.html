            Implementation services
            1. General conditions
            If not stated explicitly otherwise, all meetings are delivered through a virtual meeting solution. All participants shall attend individually and be equipped with a headset.
            
            Scope of the packages is based on our best experience. Usually this is a minimum scope of implementation. However, every implementation is unique and therefore additional time is sometimes needed, because of specific clients' requirements. Easy Project consultants can provide a spent time report on request.
            
            If not stated explicitly otherwise, implementation is delivered in English; all documents and written documentation will be delivered in English.
            
            2. General Provisions
            2.1. New application versions
            We develop and improve the application continuously. New versions are released in the following cycles:
            
            A new version is released every three months
            The development of a new version is frozen one month before its release so that it can be tested
            Bug fixes are released every 14 days
            Your suggestions related to the application development will be implemented in cases where they are beneficial to the majority of our clients and in compliance with our product development strategy. Our goal is to make project management easier.
            
            2.2. Collaboration process
            We appreciate open communication. We are entering a mutual process of implementing new software in your company. We believe it is beneficial to both sides if we share important information openly and in time.
            
            The communication may be carried out by email, online meetings, phone calls and personal meetings. For successful completion of the implementation process, mutual communication on operational level is needed. For this reason, each party should react quickly when contacted by the counterparts. We are usually able to react within two working days.
            
            During the implementation the consultant will collaborate with our other internal departments. Resolutions of issues which are not directly related to the implementation will be delivered to you by our support team. If there is a need for an intervention on the client’s server or another server-related consultation the communication will be passed to our server support specialists. If you are not fully satisfied with the work of our support departments during the implementation, please advise your consultant. Your feedback is important to us.
            
            2.3. Prepaid MANDAYS (MD) and reporting of the spent time
            The information on the number of prepaid MANDAYS can be found in the introductory table of this protocol. The implementation is usually carried out remotely. If you preferred personal meetings it is possible to arrange them in the Easy Software offices. Should you prefer to arrange meetings at your premises, it is possible to cover the travel expenses from the prepaid budget (the implementation scope). Travel costs might be also invoiced separately. We charge the whole time spent travelling from / to customer premises by the consultant.
            
            The spent time reports are typically sent to the client when approximately half of the implementation MANDAYS from the prepaid budget is spent and then when the last few hours are left. A consultant provides, separately from the time report, a proposal on how to spend the remaining hours.
            
            The implementation consists of the following phases. The sum of the time spent on each phase is equal to the total prepaid budget of MANDAYS. The lowest time value charged to customer is 0,25 hour.
            
            Initial analysis
            Initial online meeting
            Configuration of the application (the work effort depends on the complexity of the requirements on the settings)
            Training
            Additional requirements on the configuration
            Support during the implementation and testing during implementation (emails, phone calls)
            Specifically, the following activities are covered by the MANDAYS from the prepaid budget:
            
            Time of the consultant spent working on your implementation, configuring your application
            Analysis of your requirements
            Internal consultations of your requirements
            Required consultations
            Drawing different scenarios of how to implement your requirements
            Preparation and updates of the implementation protocol
            Implementation related meetings and phone calls
            Training
            Email communication with the consultant
            Organization, planning and scheduling the meetings
            Coordinating internal departments if their involvement is needed (Support, server specialist)
            Time of the consultant spent on the journey (unless it is paid separately, see the first paragraph)
            Management of the implementation project
            If certain system behaviour is reported as a bug but is eventually proven to be correct the time of the consultant spent dealing this request is also covered from the budget
            Work of server specialists on your server
            Work of server specialists dealing with your requests
            The following activities are not covered by the prepaid budget and hence not paid by the client:
            
            Work of the support team
            Fixing possible bugs
            2.4. Increase of the prepaid budget
            It is possible to increase the budget of prepaid MANDAYS only after your confirmation. The MANDAY (MD) rate is 490 EUR without VAT. An increase to the prepaid budget is usually necessary because of the following reasons:
